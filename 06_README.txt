#About the Data set

The data set we're going to work with contains records related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine.
It contains information from 1599 red wine samples and 4898 white wine samples. 
Input variables in the data set consist of the type of wine (either red or white wine) and 
11 additional metrics from objective tests (e.g. acidity levels, PH values, ABV, etc.), while the target/output variable is a numerical score based on sensory dataâ€”median of at least 3 evaluations (blind test) made by wine experts.
Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Due to privacy and logistic issues, there is no data about grape types, wine brand, and wine selling price.
